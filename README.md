## Development Setup

### Requirements
- Install Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org/)

### Frontend Setup
1. cd into frontend folder
  `cd frontend`

2. Install dependencies 
  `npm install`

3. Start the development server
  `npm run dev`

Note: Always run npm commands from the frontend folder where package.json is located (not from the root of the repo).

4. Testing
  `npm run test`


## Plan:

#### short-term
- Export and Import files

#### long-term
- Better state management in the frontend
- Decision between vanilla JS / React, no hybrid
- Backend for user management and storage
- DB for storage
- Tests
